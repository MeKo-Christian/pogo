## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks

- **ONNX Runtime Integration Issues**
  - Mitigation: Early prototype and extensive testing
  - Fallback: Pure Go ML libraries (GoMLX, Gorgonia)

- **Performance Degradation vs Rust**
  - Mitigation: Profiling and optimization focus
  - Fallback: Selective cgo usage for critical paths

- **Model Compatibility Issues**
  - Mitigation: Comprehensive model testing
  - Fallback: Model conversion tools

### Development Risks

- **Timeline Delays**
  - Mitigation: Iterative development with working milestones
  - Buffer: Optional features can be deferred

- **Resource Constraints**
  - Mitigation: Phased approach with core functionality first
  - Scaling: Community contribution for advanced features

### Operational Risks

- **Memory Usage in Production**
  - Mitigation: Extensive memory profiling and testing
  - Monitoring: Runtime memory usage tracking

- **Model Distribution**
  - Mitigation: Automated model download and validation
  - Fallback: Bundled model packages

## Success Criteria and Acceptance Tests

### Phase Completion Criteria

Each phase must meet the following criteria before proceeding:

- [ ] All critical todos completed
- [ ] Unit tests passing with >90% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests demonstrating functionality
- [ ] Performance benchmarks within acceptable ranges
- [ ] Code review and quality checks passed
- [ ] Documentation updated

### Final Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Complete OCR pipeline matching OAR-OCR functionality
- [ ] CLI tool with comprehensive feature set
- [ ] HTTP server service ready for production
- [ ] PDF processing capability
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Production-ready documentation
- [ ] Cross-platform binary distribution
- [ ] Performance metrics meeting requirements

This plan provides a structured approach to implementing the Go OCR system with clear milestones, comprehensive testing, and risk mitigation strategies. Each phase builds upon the previous one while maintaining working functionality throughout the development process.
