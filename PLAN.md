# Go OCR Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

Porting OAR-OCR from Rust to Go for inference-only OCR pipeline with text detection, recognition, and optional orientation correction. Supporting both CLI tool and server service deployment with PDF processing capabilities.

**Current Status**: Core pipeline functionality is complete. This plan focuses on remaining tasks to achieve feature parity with OAR-OCR and production readiness.

## Development Phases

---

## Phase 0: Critical Bug Fixes (Immediate - Week 1)

### 0.1 Dictionary and Recognition Fixes

**Issue**: OCR text recognition returns empty strings due to wrong dictionary file
**Root Cause**: Using 142-character `ppocr_keys_v1.txt` instead of 18,383-character `ppocrv5_dict.txt` required by PP-OCRv5 models

- [x] Download correct PP-OCRv5 dictionary (`ppocrv5_dict.txt`) to `models/dictionaries/`
- [x] Fix dictionary loading bug in `internal/recognizer/dictionary.go`:
  - [x] Replace `strings.TrimSpace()` with newline-only trimming to preserve whitespace characters
  - [x] Remove empty line skip to preserve ideographic space (U+3000) and other whitespace tokens
- [ ] Remove debug print statements from:
  - [ ] `internal/recognizer/inference.go` (convertIndicesToRunes function)
  - [ ] `internal/recognizer/ctc.go` (DecodeCTCGreedy function)
- [ ] Update default configuration to use `ppocrv5_dict.txt` instead of `ppocr_keys_v1.txt`
- [ ] Add tests to verify dictionary loading preserves whitespace characters
- [ ] Document dictionary requirements for PP-OCRv5 models

**Success Metric**: Text recognition produces correct output with PP-OCRv5 dictionary

### 0.2 Performance Investigation and Optimization

- [ ] Create model configuration profiles:
  - [ ] PP-OCRv5 mobile (with ppocrv5_dict.txt)
  - [ ] PP-OCRv5 server (with ppocrv5_dict.txt)
  - [ ] Legacy PP-OCRv4 (with ppocr_keys_v1.txt if needed)
- [ ] Update model auto-detection logic:
  - [ ] Detect model version from filename or metadata
  - [ ] Automatically select correct dictionary
  - [ ] Warn if dictionary mismatch detected
- [ ] Improve error messages:
  - [ ] Clear errors when dictionary size doesn't match model
